tipack
------

 This is a simple little program to generate TI data files.  To
 generate an 83+ program (for instance), run

   tipack myprog.bin -o myprog.8xp

 By default the name is MYPROG (i.e., the name of the output file,
 minus the suffix, converted to uppercase.)  If you want to use a
 different name, add -n <name>:

   tipack myprog.bin -o myprog.8xp -n COOLPRGM

 If you want the program to be protected, add -p:

   tipack asmprog.bin -o asmprog.8xp -p

 Other options:

  -t: specify the file type

  -c: specify the file comment

  -C: create complex number/list/matrix variables

  -a: set the file to be archived

  -r: don't add length bytes (only applies to types that normally have
      length bytes, such as programs and appvars)

  -v: be verbose
